# Script Creator

A script tool is one executable file. GQY reads the tool contract from comment lines at the top of the file, runs the file with JSON arguments, and hands stdout back to the model.

## Workflow

1. Write the script anywhere, the session workspace is fine. Start from a skeleton below.
2. Call `manage_script` with `action=register` and the absolute `path`. The file is copied into the scripts directory, made executable, and becomes a tool from the next tool round. Pass `scope=global` only when every persona should see it.
3. Call the new tool once with real arguments and read `success`, `exit_code`, `stdout` and `stderr` in the result.
4. To fix the script, edit the copy at the `path` that register returned and call the tool again. Code changes need no re-register. Header changes are picked up automatically as well.
5. `manage_script` with `action=list` shows registered, unregistered and disabled scripts with their directories.

## Runtime contract

- The first line must be a shebang such as `#!/usr/bin/env python3` or `#!/bin/bash`. GQY executes the file directly.
- Arguments arrive as one JSON object on stdin. The same JSON is also in the environment variable `GQY_ARGS_JSON` when it is under 64 KB.
- Nothing is passed on argv unless the header says `# Argv: flags`. That mode additionally expands `{"query":"x","limit":5,"json":true,"dry":false}` to `--query=x --limit=5 --json`. Keys are sorted, false and null are omitted, arrays and objects become JSON strings.
- Without a `Parameters` header the tool accepts any JSON object. The special key `stdin` then replaces the JSON on stdin with raw text.
- Print the result to stdout and exit 0. On failure exit non-zero and print a JSON object with `ok:false`, `error` and, when the user must act, `fix`. GQY reports the exit code and the model reads your JSON.
- Default timeout is 120 seconds, maximum 300. Output beyond 20000 characters is cut before the model sees it, so cap lists and offer a `limit` parameter.
- `GQY_SCRIPT_CACHE_DIR` points at GQY's cache directory. Keep login profiles, cookies and caches under it. Fall back to XDG defaults when the variable is missing so the script also works from a terminal.
- Default to compact human-readable output and offer `format=json` for field-by-field processing.

## Header

Comment lines right after the shebang, written as `# Key: value`. Unknown comment lines such as a coding declaration are skipped. The header ends at the first code line.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Display name: 番组日历
# Description: Query the Bangumi airing calendar. Use for "what airs today" and subject details.
# Timeout: 60
# Group: research
# Parameters:
# {
#   "type": "object",
#   "properties": {
#     "action": {"type": "string", "enum": ["calendar", "search"], "description": "calendar (default) or search"},
#     "query": {"type": "string", "description": "search keyword"}
#   }
# }
```

- `Description` is what the model sees. Write it in English. Keep the first sentence under 60 characters: in stub loading mode only that sentence is visible until the tool is loaded. Say what the tool does and when to use it first, caveats later.
- `Display name` is for humans and may be Chinese.
- `Parameters` is a JSON Schema object with `type: object`. Give every property a `description`. Omit the block for free-form tools.
- `Id` overrides the tool name derived from the file name. `battery-care.py` becomes `battery_care` without it.
- `Group` places the tool in a `load_tools` group. `Argv: flags` turns on argv expansion. `Timeout` is in seconds.
- `Platform: macos` or `Platform: linux` registers the tool only on that system. Use it when the script depends on something one OS has, such as Reminders or systemd. Omit it for scripts that run everywhere.
- `index.json` in the scripts directory can override any header field per `id`. `manage_script` writes there only the fields you pass explicitly.

## Skeletons

Python, stdin JSON:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Display name: Example
# Description: One sentence under 60 characters. Then when to use it.
# Parameters: {"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string","description":"what to look up"}},"required":["query"]}
import json
import os
import sys


def fail(error, fix=None, code=2):
    print(json.dumps({"ok": False, "error": error, "fix": fix}, ensure_ascii=False))
    sys.exit(code)


def main():
    raw = os.environ.get("GQY_ARGS_JSON") or sys.stdin.read() or "{}"
    args = json.loads(raw)
    query = args.get("query")
    if not query:
        fail("query is required")
    print(f"result for {query}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Bash, argv flags:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Display name: Example
# Description: One sentence under 60 characters.
# Argv: flags
# Parameters: {"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string","description":"what to look up"}},"required":["query"]}
set -euo pipefail
query=""
for arg in "$@"; do
  case "$arg" in
    --query=*) query="${arg#*=}" ;;
  esac
done
[ -n "$query" ] || { echo '{"ok":false,"error":"query is required"}'; exit 2; }
echo "result for $query"
```

## Rules

- Never ask the user to copy files into `~/.gqy`. Register does that.
- Never put secrets in the header or the description.
- Do not report the tool as working until you have called it once.
- Keep the script self-contained. Name third-party dependencies in a comment and fail with a `fix` message when they are missing.
